    <h1>PLOT</h1>
    <h4>Casablanca is a 1942 American romantic drama anti-Nazi propaganda
    film directed by Michael Curtiz and based on Murray Burnett and Joan
    Alison's unproduced stage play Everybody Comes to Rick's.
    The film stars Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and Paul Henreid;
    it features Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre,
    and Dooley Wilson. Set during World War II, it focuses on a man torn between,
    in the words of one character, "love and virtue". He must choose between his
    love for a woman and helping her Czech Resistance leader husband escape the
    Vichy-controlled Moroccan city of Casablanca to continue his fight against
    the Nazis.
