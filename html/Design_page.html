<h4>Style:
<br>For the first page, I use fixed layout to avoid unexpected change.I put the banner on the top,the video on the left-bottom and the navigation and ifame on the right-bottom
<br>I use iframe to show the multipages. And mostly I use external CSS. I also add some CSS animation to banner and navigation.
<br>I also set alt for all the images.    
<br>To make sure the text can show properly, I used default font.</h4>
<img src="../image/20141029162011.jpg" alt="the layout of my page" >
<h4 class="1" ><br>Banner:
<br>Banner is rotated and color will chang when hover on it, the subtitle has animation and linked to this page.</h4>
<h4 class="2"><br>Video:
<br>The video will be played automaticly and over and over again, the user can control it.</h4>
<h4 class="3"><br>Navigation:
<br>The navigation will change color and rotate when hover on it.</h4>
<h4 class="4"><br>Plot:
<br>I used column count to divide large number of words to make it easier to read.</h4>
<h4 class="1"><br>Cast:
<br>I put the image and text in different sequence for different actors. The cursor will also be invisible when in this page.
<br>The subtitle used "clear: both".</h4>
<h4 class="2"><br>Award:
<br>I put a image as background. The position of title and table are justified for the image. The background color of cells will be change when hover on it.
</h4>
<h4 class="3"><br>Gallary:
<br>I used skew for the title. The images will be enlarged when mouse hover on it.
</h4>
<h4 class="4"><br>Comment:
<br>I just change a little for the style of title so I used embedded scirpt for convenience. The form is in a fieldset and has the type of Number (I know in some broswers it may not be applyed),check box,textarea and submit.I use post, however I don't know where it should be sent to, so I leave blank in action.
</h4>
<h4 class="1"><br>Whole Site:
<br>I use black and white color as classic style to match the classic style of the video.</h4>
<h4 class="2"><br>Acknowledgement:
<br>The image I used for award page's background is from www.windstream.com</h4>
